// This is my basic size, it is used as the main font size and *all* other things are scaled off it (except the gutter).
// The only size that should be set without a variable from this file is 0.
$base: 20px;

// This is the value that defines the vertical rhythm for the whole document.
// All text sizes share this spacing, except for H2 that has double.
// In order to maintain consistency a px size must be used.
// $vspace is the vertical margin and should be the same as $line-height to maintain rhythm.
$line-height: round($base * 1.6);
$vspace: $line-height;

// Gutter is the space from edge of screen. 
// Fixed to look neat on all sizes without wasting screen space.
$gutter: 5px;

// The max width for pure text content.
// I want roughly 60 characters per line for hard reading.
// Normal fonts have a height width raio of around 2.2:1
// The height is multiplied to achieve a rough CPL.
$reading-width: $base * 27;

// This is the max with for any content, including large images, code and titles.
// These kinds of content like to exploit as much space as possible.
// However using more than double the reading width looks clumsy and confusing.
$content-width: $reading-width * 2;

// Other text is things like bullets and blockquotes.
// Bullets enjoy longer lines, better flow, they already have visual aids to help the eye.
// Also gives space for the extra gutter parts of these elements.
$other-text-width: $reading-width * 1.5;

// Used for side information, such as post-date subtitle.
$small-font-size: $base * 0.9;

// Some highly specific adjustments:
$blockquote-side-line: round($base / 2);
$syntax-border-thickness: 1px;
$bullet-padding: $base;

// Monospace fonts can appear large inline with normal text.
$syntax-font-size: $base * 0.9;

// Tweaked to make parts of the website fit mobile phone screens.

$big-art-size: round($base * 1.3);

// Header 2 and 3 are boxed.
$header-border: 1px;
