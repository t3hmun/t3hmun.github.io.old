<h3 id="background">Background</h3>

<p>A few months ago I acquired a small <a href="http://www.irwin.com/tools/handsaws/dovetaildetail-saw">Irwin pullsaw</a>, which was quite enjoyable to use for making small clean cuts and flush cutting. It is not great when cutting more than an inch in any direction, since the flexibility of the blade seems to make it wander. At odd angles and depth my stiff bladed tenon saw is much easier to control. However it has its use and the clean fast cuts it makes are delightful.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I bent and damaged the little Irwin pullsaw by attacking a sheet of chip board a little too aggressively. So I began the hunt for a replacement. I had a look at the more expensive brands but was not convinced it’d be worth the investment for me. I settled on the Vaughan Bear Saw BS150D. It cost less than £15, has a double sided blade and there don’t seem to be any complaints in customer reviews.</p>

<p>Disturbingly I could not find any info on the pitch/type of the blade sides on the sales listings. Tis’ a small gamble.</p>

<h3 id="a-closer-look">A Closer Look</h3>

<p>A simple plastic handle, seems well made and solid enough.</p>

<div><img alt="BS150D front" src="http://t3hmun.github.io/images/BS150D-front.png" /></div>

<p>And the back seem boring enough..</p>

<div><img alt="BS150D back" src="http://t3hmun.github.io/images/BS150D-back.png" /></div>

<p>..well actually what’s that logo at the base of the handle?</p>

<p><img src="http://t3hmun.github.io/images/z-saw-logo.png" alt="Z-Saw logo" /></p>

<p>It is Z-Saw, a well known Japanese saw brand. It seems apparent that they are the real manufacturers of this saw. This is supported by the ‘Made in Japan’ label on the blade and also that Vaughan <a href="http://www.vaughanmfg.com/shopping/Departments/Dalluge-Tools/Z-Japanese-Hand-Saws.aspx">directly sell</a> Z-Saw’s products from their website.</p>

<p>I had a flick though the Z-Saw catalogue and the closest thing I could find was the unusually coloured <a href="http://www.z-saw.co.jp/en/02b_30023_flash145.html">Z-Saw Flush S-145</a>. I can’t find the double a sided blade version on their website, however I did find a one on sale under the TopMan-Z brand on <a href="http://www.woodworkprojects.co.uk/shop.htm#!/S-145-flush-double/p/2017677/category=162171">British</a> and <a href="https://www.carbatec.com.au/handtools-and-handplanes/japanese-saws/saws/japanese-flush-cutting-saw">Australian</a> websites. It is either an old or export only model.</p>

<div><img alt="Z-Saw Flush S-145" src="http://t3hmun.github.io/images/Z-Saw-Flush-S-145.png" /></div>

<p><img src="http://t3hmun.github.io/images/TopMan-Z.png" alt="TopMan-Z Version of the saw" /></p>

<p>It’s nice to know that the saw is made by a well known company that presumably knows what it is doing.</p>

<h3 id="specifications">Specifications</h3>

<p>Handily the listing for the TopMan-Z version show detail the blades as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Pitch 1.2/1.5 mm (17/21 TPI)</p>

  <p>Blade length 150 mm</p>

  <p>Thickness 0.4 mm</p>

  <p>Kerf 0.4 mm</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I confirmed these measurements with callipers and a ruler. The TPI of the finer side is almost the same as the Irwin Dovetail saw, which is 22TPI.</p>

<div><img alt="Irwin and Vaughan saw teeth compared" src="http://t3hmun.github.io/images/Irwin-vs-Vaughan-tiny-TPI.png" /></div>

<p>I believe the teeth are for cross-cut sawing, with the typical rather aggressive rake of Japanese pullsaws.</p>

<h3 id="initial-opinion">Initial Opinion</h3>

<p>Seems like a nice little saw, don’t seem to be any obvious issues. It’ll be a while before I’ve used it enough to say more. I’ll refrain from abusing it on chipboard this time.</p>
