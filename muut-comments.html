<h1 class="post-title">Muut Comments</h1>
<h2>Things You Should be Aware of Before Using Comments</h2>
<p>
  Muut is a system run by a third party (Muut.inc). It is an easy way for me to accept comments at the bottom of each blog post. The comments are saved on their servers.
</p>
<p>
  This also means that we are subject to their <a alt="terms of use" href="https://muut.com/terms/">terms of use</a>. A particularly significant clause being:
</p>
<p>
  An extract of their terms of use 8th September 2015:
  <blockquote>When providing us with content or posting content on Muutâ€™s site or related third-party sites, you grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, sublicensable (through multiple tiers) right AND LICENSE to exercise any and all copyright, trademark, publicity, and database rights you have in the content, in any media known now or in the future.</blockquote>
</p>
<p>
  This basically means that you don't want to put anything valuable in the comments. Since this is just comments, which should just be simple conversation, it shouldn't be a serious issue.
</p>
<p>
  Most comment systems track the websites that you visit (it is commercially valuable data). I don't know Muut's policy on this. 
</p>

<h2>Why Am I Using a Third-Party System</h2>
<p>
  My website is statically hosted on GitHub. This kind of hosting does not have the data saving ability required for comments. Therefore, like many people I rely on a third party.

  Eventually I will set up my own server, eliminating my need to rely on a third party. However this will cost money and time. It may be a while before I get around to it.
