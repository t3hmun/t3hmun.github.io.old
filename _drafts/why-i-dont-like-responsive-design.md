The first time I encountered responsive design it was wonderful. The same page working on different displays, what could be bad about that? But then I realised something; it's not the same page anymore. With most the designs i've seen content and functionality is lost as the window / screen is made smaller. 

If a page has parts that can be sacrificed, why was it there in the first place. This may seem a bit of an extreme view but i'm not a fan of extra complicatioon and ditractions.
