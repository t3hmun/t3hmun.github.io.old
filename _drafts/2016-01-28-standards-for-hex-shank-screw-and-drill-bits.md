It was hard to find a solid guide on what the compatible standards for various kinds of hex shank bits and attachments. This is the information I've cobbled together from product listing and the handy _schraublexikon_ at the back of [Wera's catalogue](http://www.wera-tools.co.uk/katalogdownload_uk.html). 

ISO 1173 and DIN 3126 appear to be corresponding the standards that define the specifications for various styles of hex bits and adapters.

Products that bother to list the standard will any one or both of the standards, followed by a letter and number. The letter is the shape and the number is the size in mm (this seems to only toughly correspond to the inch size).

## Most Screwing Bits / Adapters

It appears that `C 6.3` bits ( mostly stubby 1/4" hex screw bits) are compatible with `D 6.3` adapters (mostly ratchet screwdrivers and 1/4" magnetic bit holders).

The C and D styles are usually only held together with magnets, which makes the fine for screwing but not great for drilling where you need to pull back without the bit falling out.

## Most Drilling Bits / Adapters

`E 6.3` are the hex shank bits with the squashed neck near the end, which lock into `F 6.3` adapters. However only Wera seems to mention `F.6.3` in their literature, most impact drivers specs just call it a _1/4" quick change_.
