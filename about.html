<p>This is my personal blog, created to motivate me to document my own work and share anything useful in the process.</p>

<p>The content is mostly programming and computer stuff, but there is also other diy related stuff.</p>

<p>The theme of this website is <a href="http://t3hmun.github.io/t3hsite/">based on one</a> that I created in order to learn the basics of CSS, SASS and webpage layout.</p>

<p>My contact email can be found at the bottom of every page.</p>
