<p>Content is mostly programming related, with an occasional touch of woodwork.</p>

<p>The theme of this website is <a href="http://t3hmun.github.io/rather-simple-jekyll-theme/">based on one</a> that I created in order to learn the basics of CSS, SASS and webpage layout across multiple size devices.</p>

<p>My contact email can be found at the bottom of every page.</p>
